# Codenames Game

Codenames is a multiplayer word association game where two teams compete to find all their agents' codenames first. This implementation uses Qt for the user interface and WebSockets for real-time interaction between players.

## Requirements


#### Network Requirements for Online Play

The network you are using must allow websocket traffic. In our testing, the uwosecure-v2 and eduroam wifi's don't have it configured, but something like a cellular hotspot allows for it.

Another solution is to utilize tunnels (such as ngrok... etc) to allow external devices to connect to your server
